<h2>
    Summer Transfers
</h2>

<p>
It looks like this summer transfer window is going to be a busy one for Bayern as they look to sign a lot of new players. Their main target is <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_San%C3%A9">Leroy Sané</a>. Leroy Sané is a very fast winger that has good shooting, crossing and passing. This type of player suits Bayerns playing style well plus he´s german and he will be in the starting lineup almost every game. But Sané wont be cheap.

         />
<h3>
Central Attackin Midfielder   
</h3>
Bayern is Locking for a CAM/false nine. Right now they have Müller and Couthinho but Couthinho is on loan and Müller can play as a winger. Thats way Bayern are looking for a CAM/false nine. The players they are interestad of is... 
    <li> <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz">Kai Havertz </a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Firmino">Roberto firmino</a> </li>
Both of them will be very expensive signings and with Sané as there main target they might not be able to afford Firmino or Havertz.
    <div>
<h3>
    Firmino vs Havertz
</h3>
<img
 src="https://d3j2s6hdd6a7rg.cloudfront.net/v2/uploads/media/default/0001/94/thumb_93855_default_news_size_5.jpeg"   
     />
Firmino vs Havertz: They has or plays in the Bundesliga which is good because they know how the game works there.
<br>
Both of them are good at passing, have a good shot and are very technical, but altough they are great in those abilities Firmino is better. So Firmino is a better player but the thing with Havertz is that he is just 20 years old and has great potenial. If Bayern buys him they can have him for over ten years but if they buy Firmino he will only be good for five years. A plus for Havertz is that he´s german so it will be easier for him to communicate on and of the pitch.
<br>
        <br>
So both of them are good players that will be good for at least a few years but Firmino will be expensive but still cheaper then Havertz. So in the end I think that Firmino will be the better option but Havertz is still a good one. The reason Firmino will be better is because he´s a better player right now, cheaper and if Bayern buys Firmino Liverpool will probaly buy Werner and that will make RB Leipzig much worse which is very good for Bayern.

<h3>
   Defender 
</h3>
Bayern is looking for a young backup defender that could be a star in the future. The reason they want a defender is that there has been a lot of injury problems this season in the defend.
    <br>
    <br>
Their main targets in those positions are...
    <li> <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayot_Upamecano">Dayot Upamecano</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergi%C3%B1o_Dest">Sergiño Dest</a> </li>
<img src="https://tmssl.akamaized.net//images/foto/normal/dayot-upamecano-1552984324-21202.jpg" 
     />
<h4>
Upamecano    
    </h4>
<p>
Upamecano is a young good centerback with a lot of pace and good physicality. One of the main reasons Bayern wants to buy him is because he was very good against them when they played. He managed to stop Lewandowskin from scoring and that is not easy. The only problem with buying Upamecano is that Unitad and Arsenal want him and there ha will start almost every game but in Bayern he will be on the bench more. So if Bayern want him it´s going to be expensive and they most give him a big salary so that Bayern could be more desireble than the other clubs.
<h4>
Dest
    </h4>
<img src="https://tmssl.akamaized.net//images/foto/normal/sergino-dest-ajax-amsterdam-1580724930-31022.jpg" 
     />
<p>
Dest is a 19 year old american right back that plays for Ajax. Altough Dest is only 19 years old he´s played 16 games for Ajax in the Eredivise this season starting 11 of them and has got 4 assists in those games. He has played more games then Mazraoui that was Ajax starter right back last season.
<br>
Dest will be a cheap signing for Bayern and there is no other club that wants to sign him right now. But Dest will not get that much game time if he joins Bayern because both Pavard and Kimmich plays as rightbacks and for that reason Dest might not want to join Bayern.
<br>
    <h2>
Captain
    </h2>
<p>
The captain of Bayern München is of course <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer">Manuel Neuer</a>.
<img src="https://img.bundesliga.com/tachyon/sites/2/2019/06/neuer_calm.jpg?crop=0px,0px,1920px,1080px&amp;fit=1140" 
     />
<p>
Manuel Neuer is the best keeper in the Bundesliga and has been that for a long time now. He was born 27 march 1986 in Gelsenkirchen which makes him 33 years old.
   <br>
First Neuer played six years in Schalke 04 before he joined Bayern in 2011. In Schalke 04 he only won the DFB-pokal and the league cup ones. But in Bayern he has won seven Bundesliga trophies, one Champions League, the DFB-pokal three times, German supercup three times UEFA Super cup one time and World cup for clubs one time. In 2014 he also won the World cup with Germany. He is also captain in the german national team.
